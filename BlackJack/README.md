BLACK JACK PROJECT

This is a Capstone project on Black Jack game. This is a simple Black Jack Game program created in Python.
Here are a few Python concepts used to create this program:
1. Libraries and Dictionaries
2. Functions
3. Recursion (recursive functions)
4. Lists and Tuples
Among others.

This is how the program is supposed to work. There is a deck of cards, where K, Q and J are represented by the number 10.
Ace can either be counted as 1 or 11 and this is to be decided by the player depending on how close the player count is to 21.

The aim of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible and the winner is the one with the closest count to 21 but not more than 21.

Any count more than 21 is an automatic loss and is referred to as a BUST.

When the player score is greater than the dealer score but is not more than 21, the Player wins.

When the dealer score is greater than the Player score but is not more than 21, the Dealer wins.

If the dealer score is less than 17, the dealer MUST draw another card from the deck.
