Blind Auction

A program that will collect the names and bids of different people. The program should asks each bidder's name and their bid individually.

**This is how the program should work**
Welcome to the secret auction program.
What is your name?: Angela

What's your bid?: $123

Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no'.
yes

If there are other bidders, the screen should clear, so you can pass your phone to the next person. If there are no more bidders, then the program should display the name of the winner and their winning bid.

The winner is Elon with a bid of $55000000000

This program makes use of Python dictionaries and loops.
